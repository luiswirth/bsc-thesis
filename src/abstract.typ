  = Abstract

  Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) is a mathematical framework
  for formulating the theory of the Finite Element Method in a more elegant and a more general way.

  This thesis aims to develop an implementation of FEEC in Rust.
  So far there exists only one general library for FEEC on the internet, implemented in Haskell.
  Using Rust we will achieve better performance and create a library that is actually useful for solving
  problems.

  The creation of this working implementation is not the only added value this thesis tries to generate.
  This thesis should also serve as a guidenbook on how to create other similar implementations of FEEC
  in other programming languages or with different paradigmes. In this regard this work tries to
  lay out the necessary steps without relying too much on the vast and complicated mathematical framework
  that was created around FEEC. This thesis is more pragmatic and should appeal to a wider audiance
  than the original books and papers on FEEC.
