  = Abstract

  Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) is a mathematical framework
  for formulating the theory of the Finite Element Method. Instead of only relying
  on vector calculus it makes use of the far more general theory of Differential Forms.

  There are extremly few implementations of FEEC available.
  The most popular is #link("https://github.com/Airini/FEECa")[FEECa].
  Which is a Finite Element Exterior Calculus Implementation in Haskell.
  However Haskell is not a language that is suited for High Performance Computing (HPC)
  but rather known for it's mathmatical expressiveness.
  Rust combines these two traits of being high performant, while still being
  expressive.
